      <h3>Olivia Palermo</h3>
        <p1>&emsp;Olivia Palermo (born February 28, 1986) is an American socialite. Palermo came to prominence after being cast in the reality television series The City in 2009, which documented the personal and professional lives of Whitney Port and her rich friends.
        &emsp;The reason I selected her as my icon is because she is not like other celebrities who only wear those designer brands outfits. She choose different kinds of brands to mix and match, which is very special and attractive to me.
