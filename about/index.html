      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>&emsp;Hi, guys! My name is Sujia Wu, a senior at Illinois institute of Technology.
        I am a business major, specialized in Finance and I will graduate in May 2017.
        I really enjoy taking this ITM 361 class and I believe that I will learn a lot
        from this class. Out of my school life, I like going jogging and swimming. I also like dogs,
        especially big dogs. I have a Doberman Pinscher and a German Shepherd. That's why I named
        my website as "puppylover".</p>
      <h3>My Icon</h3>
      <p>&emsp;My fashion icon is Olivia Palermo. She is an American socialite. She was born in 
      February 28, 1986. She is one of the main characters in the reality television 
      series The City. She wed German model Johannes Huebl at a small ceremony in Bedford, 
      New York.</p> 
      <p>&emsp;Here is a 40-second video from one of my favorite songs that is written by Sia. 
      I really like her voice that I think it is very unique. Hope you enjoy it too!</p>
